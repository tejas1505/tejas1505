# 👋 Hi, I'm Arun — Software Engineer | Systems & Backend Focus

I build **scalable, production-grade software systems** with a strong focus on
performance, reliability, and real-world usage.

I enjoy working close to the system boundaries — APIs, databases, real-time communication,
and infrastructure — where architectural decisions actually matter.

## 🧩 How I Think About Engineering

- Architecture before implementation
- Measure performance, don’t guess
- Prefer simple systems that scale
- Clear data models > clever abstractions
- Reliability is a feature

---

## 📌 Current Interests

- Distributed systems
- Real-time communication at scale
- Backend performance & observability
- System design trade-offs

---

> *I value code that is readable, systems that are predictable,  
> and decisions that hold up under scale.*
